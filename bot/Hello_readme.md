Hello
Well so theres a couple things we need to figure out with this lttle bot. The thing is we need to
limit the scope of what the bot can do.
- Get self information
  - get top posts by category
  - get top 5 posts by data
  - search in main files, archive and not archive
- Search information of the world
  - search in friend stuff 
  - search in world stuff
- Searching for specific items

I need to connect the bot to the main database
Ok now that it is limited i should create the request for all this features.
Thenwhat i should do is create the order for the bot so it knows what it can do
Then i need to fix the errors that come up with the stinky bot.
Then i implement the authentication in telegram
